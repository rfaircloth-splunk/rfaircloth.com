I’m sharing something today that has been available thanks to many in white papers and presentations dealing with identification of malicious code and activities in your windows event data. Shout out to everyone from our [“friends” at the NSA,](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/reports/spotting-the-adversary-with-windows-event-log-monitoring.cfm) to Splunk .Conf presenters and [malwarearcheology.com](https://www.malwarearchaeology.com) just to name a few.

The PDF attached is a portion of the next evolution of the Use Case Repository I maintain at Splunk. Along with the reference TAs and inputs, this will allow you to quickly and consistently collect very valuable data supporting security use cases at multiple levels of maturity. If it seems like too much don’t work Splunk Pro Services and partners are able to help you get this visibility just contact your account team.

Standard disclaimer, this is a blog post, I built the content from public non-warrantied information, and this is still public non-warrantied information, your situation might not match the advice given.
