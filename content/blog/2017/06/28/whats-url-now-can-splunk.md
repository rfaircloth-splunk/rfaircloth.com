Hunting we find URLs in logs both email and proxy that are interesting all the time. What will that URL return, if it redirects where is it going and what kind of content questions you might be asking. If you are not asking them now is the time to start. Iâ€™ve released a new add on to Splunk Base, a little adaptive response action that can be used with just Splunk Enterprise OR Splunk Enterprise Security to collect and index information about those URLs.
