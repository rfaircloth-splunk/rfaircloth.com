Ok, I said posts in threes so here it is. We all know RYSLOG config is much more painful than syslog-ng but for reasons beyond all of our control, it is readily available for more customers than syslog-ng is today. Thanks to Splunk users I want to share a couple links to better doc to make this not so awful

- Usenix https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/06\_lang-online.pdf

thank you @mattymo and @lowell via Splunk Slack chat
