This is a rather long time coming, today version 4.0.0 of SecKit for Geolocation with MaxMind is available for Splunk via Splunk base and Splunk cloud. This version includes a built in solution for keeping the database files up to date for both free and paid subscribers. Free subscribers are of course limited to the basic information available as equivalent to the built in iplocation command from Splunk. Commercial subscribers can use all of available fields from their licensed files. Jump over to Splunk base to check it out <https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3022/>
