Most users by how have heard they should keep their Windows PCs up to date to avoid infection. Unfortunately, our adversaries have heard the same speech and are trying to deceive through fake updates for your computer. First reliable companies will not notify you by email, instant message, or advertisement that your computer is out of date and needs an update. You may see email or advertisements for new versions or upgrades, and subscription renewals. Some leading software companies are helping us stay secure through automatic or seamless updates such as Google’s Chrome browser, the FireFox Browser, and Adobe’s Flash. Security updates for these productions will simply install in the backgroud without needing your help. You can keep yourself safer by taking a few steps to secure your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Lets take care of our operating system first.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open “Computer” on Windows 7 or “This PC” on Windows 8.1</li>\n<li>Click on Control Panel in the menu bar.<br>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-05-51.png\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-05-51.png?resize=1100%2C81\" alt=\"2015-01-25_17-05-51\"></a></li>\n<li>Search for “Windows Update” (1) in control panel then select “Turn automatic updating on or off” (2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-07-24.png\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-07-24.png?resize=1100%2C527\" alt=\"2015-01-25_17-07-24\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup the options (1) (2) (3) as shown below then click ok (4)<br>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-09-13.png\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.rfaircloth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-25_17-09-13.png?resize=1100%2C527\" alt=\"2015-01-25_17-09-13\"></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Windows will now check all Microsoft Products daily for updates and install them as needed.
