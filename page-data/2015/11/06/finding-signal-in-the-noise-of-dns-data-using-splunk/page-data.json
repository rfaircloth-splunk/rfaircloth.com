For all of our queries we will rely on common information model fields and extractions. For most customers I will assist them in deploying the Splunk App for Stream to collect query information from their DNS servers in a reliable way regardless of the logging capabilities of their chosen server product.</p>\n<p>Note: Be sure to install Cedric’s <a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2734/\">URLToolbox</a> Add on we will make use of its power here.</p>\n<p>Lets start by looking at the data everyone is spending the most time talking about queries for A (ipv4) and AAA (ipv6). Lets search for no more than the last 60 min while we are working to be kind to our indexers. For real analysis you will use bigger windows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>tag=dns tag=resolution tag=dns index=* NOT source=”stream:Splunk_*” (query_type=A OR query_type=AAAA)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My sample environment is small very small 5 users, 10 windows servers. In the last 24 hours this query gave me 24,000+ results way more than I can examine lets start to cut that down. We also need to remember what we will probably be learning from our data that is which domains require investigation for suspicion of involvement in malicious activity.</p>\n<p>Reduction #1 Lets remove all domains owned by our organization for email or web hosting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the following files to include the domains used for email or web hosting.\n<ol>\n<li>Splunk_SA_CIM/lookups/cim_corporate_email_domains.csv</li>\n<li>Splunk_SA_CIM/lookups/cim_corporate_web_domains.csv</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Update our search to extract the domain and tld for latter use. this is more complicated than it looks so we will make up a uri and let UTToolbox do the work for us</li>\n<li>The new base search will look like this<br>\ntag=dns tag=resolution tag=dns NOT source=”stream:Splunk_*” index=* (query_type=A OR query_type=AAAA)<br>\n| eval uri=”dnsquery://”+query<br>\n| <code class=\"language-text\">ut\\_parse(uri)</code> | fields – ut_fragment ut_netloc ut_params ut_path ut_port ut_query ut_scheme</li>\n<li>Now we can use our email and web domain lookups to reduce the data set we are working with.

I have queries for .local domains I can’t explain but I know are not malicious, bare host names (no period) and I have a couple of devices servicing DNS from guest wifi identify those points and update the search to remove them. This leaves me with 216 domains to investigate.
