If your organization is like most now is the time you are being asked how you can implement these detection strategies. Leveraging your existing Splunk investment you can get started very quickly with less change to your organization than one might think. Here is what we will use older versions will work fine however the screen shots will be a bit off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Splunk Enterprise 6.3.1</li>\n<li>Splunk App for Stream 6.4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will assume Splunk Enterprise 6.3.1has already been installed.</p>\n<p>Decide where to install your Stream App. Typically this will be the Enterprise Security search head. <del>However if your ES search head is also a search head cluster you will need to use an AD-HOC search head, dedicated search head or a deployment server. </del>Current versions of Stream fully support installation on a Search Head Cluster.</p>\n<p>Note: If using the deployment server (DS) you must configure the server to search the indexer or index cluster containing your stream data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Splunk App for Stream using the standard procedures located <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StreamApp/latest/DeployStreamApp/AboutSplunkAppforStream\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Copy the deployment TA to your deployment server if you installed on a search head. /opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps/Splunk_TA_stream</li>\n<li>On your deployment server create a new folder to contain configuration for your stream dns server group.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>mkdir -p Splunk_TA_stream_infra_dns/local</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Copy the inputs.conf from the default TA to the new TA for group management</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>cp Splunk_TA_stream/local/inputs.conf Splunk_TA_stream_infra_dns/local/</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Update the inputs.conf to include your forwarder group id</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>vi Splunk_TA_stream_infra_dns/local/inputs.conf</li>\n<li>Alter “stream_forwarder_id =” to “stream_forwarder_id =infra_dns”</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Create a new server class “infra_stream_dns” include both the following apps and deploy to all DNS servers (Windows DNS or BIND)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Splunk_TA_stream</li>\n<li>Splunk_TA_stream_infra_dns</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Reload your deployment server</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Excellent at this point the Splunk Stream app will be deployed to all of your DNS servers and sit idle.
