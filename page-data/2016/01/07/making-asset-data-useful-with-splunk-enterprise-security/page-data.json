Two years ago when you implemented your first SIEM you gave your consultant an excel file listing all of your servers on the corporate network. You promised you would spend time on it after the consultant left but, then you got the new FireEye. You didn’t forget but then the you got a new Next Gen firewall and after there was the new red team initiative.</p>\n<p>It is time make a difference in the security posture of your organization. It is time to take a bite out of CSC #1a that’s not a typo we need to work on #1a, #2 can wait. so can #1b .It is time to work SANs critical control #1. I know the CMDB is out of date and doesn’t reflect today’s architecture. We can do a lot with a small amount of work, today I will share how to lay a foundation to address <span class=\"label\">CSC 1: Inventory of Authorized (a) and Unauthorized Devices (b).</span></p>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<h6>Objective 1: <strong>Identify the location of each asset using latitude, longitute, city state and zip</strong></h6>\n<h6>Objective 2: <strong>Identify the compliance zone for each network segment</strong></h6>\n<h6>Objective 3: <strong>Identify categories that can assist the analyst in review of events related to the network containing the source or destination</strong></h6>\n<h6>Objective 4: <strong>Identify the minimum priority of devices in a given network segment.</strong></h6>\n<p>Code is provided via <a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3055/\">Security Kit</a> Install the app “SecKit_SA_idm_common” on your ES Search head.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Don’t forget to update the app imports to include “SecKit_SA_.*”</h5>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Walkthrough</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Update seckit_idm_pre_cidr_location.csv so that for each subnet in cidr notation define the location. On a very large campus it may be desirable to present a point on a specific building however in most cases it will be adequate to have a single lat/long pair for all subnets on a campus. Include all private and public spaces owned or managed by your organization do not include any public space not external spaces such as hosting providers and cloud services.</li>\n<li>Update seckit_idm_pre_cidr_category.csv note subnet in this case may be larger or smaller than used in locations. The most precise definition will be utilized by Splunk Identity Management within Enterprise Security. This may contain cloud address space if the ip space is not continually re-purposed</li>\n<li>Populate pci_cidr_domain we will overload this field for non PCI environments.\n<ol>\n<li>PCI usage “wireless ORtrust|cardholder OR trust|dmz OR empty (empty or default represents untrust</li>\n<li>Non PCI usage substitute other compliance in place of cardholder such as pii, sox, hippa, cip</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Populate cidr_priority\n<ol>\n<li>low the most often used value should represent the majority of your devices</li>\n<li>medium common servers</li>\n<li>high devices of significant importance</li>\n<li>critical devices requiring immediate response such as\n<ol>\n<li>A server whose demise would cause you to work on Christmas</li>\n<li>A server whose demise could cause the closure of the company even if you work on Christmas</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Populate cidr_category values provided here would apply to all devices in this network.
