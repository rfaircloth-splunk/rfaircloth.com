As a segment of society, I think tech is willfully changing. Every now and then I have something to say on this topic. If it is not personal to me I don’t say much honestly because so much is already said and virtue signaling is a bad look. I commented recently on laziness in ML leading to re-enforced bias. <a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/12/21/038250/successful-it-workers-applaud-non-traditional-paths-to-tech\">Gatekeeping </a>in tech has been an issue that has personally impacted me. My path to tech was a unique one, I wasn’t a Barista I was a bored C student in an underperforming rural Alabama highschool that learned how to “tech” the business way. I liked solving problems and people would pay me well to solve computer problems so that’s what I learned. I started really small. Networking Mac computers on apple talk using phonenet connectors to solve a problem the poor rural kids I went to school within Skipperville Alabama needed more opportunity to learn to read than their parents could provide them (Thank you Pizzahut). Also thank you one stoplight little town for giving me a chance to get started. My path to IT Started because no one in “tech” was willing to solve the problem. I’ve built a worldwide reputation not on my formal education but on my customer focus. I don’t like the gatekeeping in tech but I also highly value education and well-educated knowledgeable teams I work with. I often find especially west coast tech community members are focused on tech for tech’s sake and that’s great for R&#x26;D but it brings solutions to real problems which are where “non-traditional” people like me come in. While I might not be the guy that invents a new way of storing machine data I am the guy you call to build the largest application of that software in the world we can’t do this without diversity.</p>\n<p>Lets talk about that phrase non-traditional. Think about the 10 names in tech you can quickly and got find their resume online. I promise you most of them don’t have formal tech education Like me we came to tech not because tech attracted us but the problem attracted us. Yes more people are in tech today because of STEM education but I would argue I am “classically trained” :). Lets work together to solve the worlds problems, I say for 2021 lets turn off the zoom camera. Change how we evaluate resumes to be focused on passion outcomes and less on certifications and degrees.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Commitment to diversity in tech","date":"December 21, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/11/13/maxmind-databases-and-splunk-enterprise/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MaxMind Databases and Splunk Enterprise"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/12/21/how-sht-we-didnt-think-you-would-check-our-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oh Sh**T we didn't think you would check our work."}}},"pageContext":{"id":"80df8785-9d4e-54e2-9fd5-6f74f1f32c69","previousPostId":"be427031-2848-5b0d-8ce1-835437c56c73","nextPostId":"de3d34a8-267c-5b04-b0a3-5c37812e9a90"}},
