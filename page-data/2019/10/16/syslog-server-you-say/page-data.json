In seven days I will be presenting the culmination of small developments that have taken shape into the brand new Splunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S).</p>\n<p>You don’t have to wait swing over via Splunk Base <a href=\"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4740/#/details\">https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4740/#/details</a></p>\n<p>SC4S is designed to:</p>\n<p>Do the heavy lifting of deploying a functioning current build of the awesome syslog-ng OSE (3.24.1 as of this posting).</p>\n<p>Support many popular syslog vendor products OOB with zero configuration or as little configuration as a host glob or IP address</p>\n<p>Scale your Splunk vertically by very evenly distributing events across indexers by the second</p>\n<p>Scale your syslog-ng servers by reducing constrains on CPU and disk</p>\n<p>Reduce your exposure to data loss by minimizing the amount of data at rest on the syslog-ng instance</p>\n<p>Promote great practices and collaboration. SC4S is a liberally licensed open source solution. We will be able to collaborate directly with the end users on filters and usage to promote great big data deployments.</p>\n<p>Personal thanks to many but especially Mark Bonsack and Balazs Scheidler (syslog-ng creator)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Syslog server you say","date":"October 16, 2019","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/08/16/bias-in-ml/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bias in ML"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/11/17/a-syslog-time-zone-is-a-terrible-thing-to-get-wrong/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A syslog time zone is a terrible thing to get wrong"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e71449dd-feff-555d-89ea-a92850123a6c","previousPostId":"b96397cf-f945-500a-ae19-a2aa218691e2","nextPostId":"e96b8d7a-7308-5406-b9d9-6b9f6dc0389e"}},
