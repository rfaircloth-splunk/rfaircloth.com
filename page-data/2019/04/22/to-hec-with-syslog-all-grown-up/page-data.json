This little idea implemented in python started solving real problems of throughput and latency while reducing the complexity of configuring syslog aggregation servers. I’m very pleased to say the <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/rfaircloth-splunk/rsyslog-omsplunk/src\">python script</a> I created is now obsolete. Leading syslog server products syslog-ng and rsyslog upstreams have implemented maintained modules. Even more exciting Mark Bonsack has invested considerable time to further develop modular configuration for both to make getting data though syslog and into Splunk even easier!</p>\n<p>Native syslog –> http event collector modules</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/syslog-ng-premium-edition/7.0.12/administration-guide/sending-and-storing-log-messages-%E2%80%94-destinations-and-destination-drivers/splunk-hec-sending-messages-to-splunk-http-event-collector/\">Syslog-NG</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omhttp.html?highlight=omhttp\">RSYSLOG</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modular Configuration Repositories</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/SPLServices/splunk-syslog-ng\">Syslog-NG</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/SPLServices/splunk-rsyslog.\">RSYSLOG</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quick Public Service Notice</h1>\n<p>While all linux distributions include a syslog server this should NOT be used as the production syslog aggregation solution. Linux distros are often many point releases or worse selectively back port patches based only on their own customer reported issues. Before attempting to build a syslog aggregation solution for production it is critical you source current upstream binaries or build your own.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"To HEC with syslog All grown up","date":"April 22, 2019","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/12/is-your-ldap-slow-it-might-make-your-splunk-slow/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is your LDAP Slow?
